    <h1>What is creation phase and execution phase?</h1>
    <pre>
        Compiler runs through the entire code for 2 time before actually executing the code, and
        generates a Global Execution context , inside this we have two phases creation phase and
        execution phase

    <h1>What are objects in javascript?</h1>
    <pre>
        In JavaScript, an object is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair is
        called a property.
        The key of a property can be a string. And the value of a property can be any value, e.g., a
        string, a number, an array, and even a function.
        JavaScript provides you with many ways to create an object. The most commonly used one is
        to use the object literal notation.
         
    </pre>
    <h1>What are function constructors?</h1>
    <pre>
        In JavaScript, a constructor gets called when an object is created using the new keyword.
         The purpose of a constructor is to create a new object and set values for any existing object properties.
    </pre>
    <h1>Explain prototypes</h1>
    <pre>
        Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another.
        Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called its prototype.
        The prototype is itself an object, so the prototype will have its own prototype, making what's
        called a prototype chain.
        The chain ends when we reach a prototype that has null for its own prototype.

    </pre>
    <h1>What is prototype chain</h1>
    <pre>
        Prototype chaining is used to build new types of objects based on existing ones. It is similar to
        inheritance in a class based language.
        The prototype on object instance is available through Object.getPrototypeOf(object) or proto
        property whereas prototype on constructors function is available through Object.prototype.

    <h1>Give an example of inheritance using function constructor</h1>
    <pre>
        function Employee(name, age, gender, id) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.gender = gender;
        this.id = id;
        };
        function Developer(name, age, gender, id, specialization) {
        // Calling Employee constructor function
        Employee.call(this, name, age, gender, id);
        // Adding a new parameter
        this.specialization = specialization;
        }
        // Creating objects
        let Employee1 = new Employee("Suraj", 28, "Male", 564);
        let Developer1 = new Developer("Karishma", 31, "Female", 345,
        "Frontend Developer");
        console.log(Employee1);
        console.log(Developer1);
    </pre>
    <h1>What are callbacks?</h1>
    <pre>
        A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument. This function is
        invoked inside the outer function to complete an action. Let's take a simple example of how to
        use callback function
